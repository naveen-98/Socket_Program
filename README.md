# Socket_Program

Python socket programming refers to the process of creating network communication between devices using sockets, which are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network. 
Sockets allow programs to establish connections and exchange data over the network, enabling communication between a client and a server or between two processes on different devices.

Python provides a built-in socket module that simplifies the implementation of socket programming. 
This module offers classes and functions to create both client-side and server-side sockets.
